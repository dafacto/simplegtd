          <h2>Core GTD principles</h2>
          <p>
            The first principle of GTD is <strong>capture</strong>—i.e. getting
            things out of your head and into a place you can rely on to keep
            them safe while they wait for later processing. This principle
            applies equally to everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            A second principle of GTD is the
            <strong>separation of tasks by context</strong>, and it is here
            where most approaches to GTD vary. Some people contextualize their
            tasks around <em>physical energy levels</em> (high, low), some
            around <em>where tasks can be done</em> (home, office, computer, on
            the phone) and some around task <em>nature</em> (work, personal,
            errands).
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve experimented with all of these, and ultimately they all fell
            short.
          </p>

        >
          <h2>My task management objectives</h2>
          <p>
            The problem starts with capture. Since the objective of capture is
            keeping your head clear, the process results in my inbox containing
            two types of tasks—those I <em>will do</em>, and those I
            <em>might do</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course there are other dimensions in which you could classify
            those tasks, but over time, I’ve discovered that the effective
            separation of these two has the most impact in making GTD actually
            work.
          </p>
          <p>The challenge then has been identifying a GTD approach that:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Shows me what I will do, without cluttering that view with things
              I might do.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allows me at any time to see the things I might want to do, and
              within the context of a particular project.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensures that I’m periodically reminded of the things I might want
              to do.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To achieve those objectives, here are the tools provided by
            OmniFocus which affect the <em>visibility</em> of tasks.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Perspectives</strong>, OmniFocus’s configurable task
              views, determine task visibility primarily through the
              “Availability” settings—“Available” or “Remaining”. (Perspectives
              can also filter on due dates; but due dates aren’t really relevant
              to whether a task will or might get done, as usually a task with a
              due date is something that will get done.)
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>Project’s status</strong> can be set to “Active”, in
              which case its tasks will be visible in both “Available” and
              “Remaining” perspective filters, or “On Hold”, in which case its
              tasks will only be visible when filtered on “Remaining”.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>Context’s status</strong> can also be set to “Active” or
              “On Hold”, with the same affect on visibility in perspective
              filters.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>“Defer” date</strong> can be assigned to a task. If that
              date is in the future, then the task will only appear in the
              “Remaining” perspective filter, and not when filtered on
              “Available”.
            </li>
          </ol>

        >
          <h2>Failed approaches</h2>
          <p>
            In the past, I tried to contextualize my tasks into “Work” and
            “Personal”, and then separate what I will and might do through the
            activity setting available to projects, e.g. using an on-hold
            project called, “Someday/Maybe”. The problem with that approach was
            that my Someday/Maybe project contained tasks relevant to a variety
            of other
            <em>real</em> projects, which made it difficult to achieve my second
            objective—allowing me to see what I might want to do—within the
            context of a particular project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to address that problem by creating on-hold “Someday/Maybe”
            child projects within each real active projects. As you can imagine,
            that became unwieldy and maintenance-heavy once the number of real
            projects grew to any sizable amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also tried creating an on-hold context called “Someday/Maybe” as a
            child context within each of my “Personal” and “Work” contexts, but
            eventually came to realize even that resulted in too much confusion
            and complexity in both initial context assignment, and when needing
            to change a given task—or group of tasks—from things I might do to
            things I will do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried several other approaches as well and the result was always
            the same—either through over-complexity or incompatibility with my
            three objectives, OmniFocus wasn’t effectively helping me to get
            things done.
          </p>

        <section

          class="max-w-lg px-4 pt-12 mx-auto prose sm:px-0"
        >
          <h2>My solution — Only use two contexts</h2>
          <p>
            Realizing that in practice I didn’t actually view my tasks by “Work”
            and “Personal” contexts very often, I tried a simpler approach,
            consisting of only <em>two contexts</em>, the purpose of which is to
            answer the question, “Is this something I will do, or something I
            might do?”:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>“Active” (with status, Active)</li>
            <li>“Maybe” (with status, On Hold)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Now, when processing, organizing and managing tasks, I ask myself
            only two questions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>What project should this belong to? (Project assignment)</li>
            <li>
              Is this something I will do, or might do? (Context assignment)
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Here’s how that simplification fits into the core of my GTD
            approach.

          <h2>Weekly review process</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Each Sunday, I use OmniFocus’s “Review” feature to review each of
              my projects. When reviewing a project, OmniFocus shows you all of
              its tasks, regardless of availability. This satisfies my third
              objective, i.e. making sure I’m periodically reminded of the tasks
              I might do.
            </li>
            <li>
              I may change the context of some tasks from “Maybe” to “Active”,
              if I’ve decided they will get done.
            </li>
            <li>
              I “flag” any “Active” task I want to work on during the following
              week.
            </li>
            <li>
              I’ll assign a future “Defer” date to any task that is “Active”,
              but which I know I won’t get to in the near future. For example,
              the task “Follow up with Steve”, if I know Steve is on vacation
              for the next two weeks. (This supports my first objective, seeing
              only those tasks which are currently relevant.)

          <h2>Conclusion — it works!</h2>
          <p>
            This approach to GTD and OmniFocus has resulted, for me, in a task
            management approach that is powerful enough to meet my objectives
            while remaining simple and efficient enough that I actually managed
            to follow it for nearly a decade! I hope it works for you, too.
